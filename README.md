One of things I use that helps greatly is kboghdady https://github.com/kboghdady/youTube_ads_4_pi-hole

# YouTube

## From a Smart TV
- I look at the 1st `googlevideo` to block when they come in two consective query reposnses back to back. A relay from video to ad to video.
- When there's a googlevideo with no ad after being est. 5 mins in, I just leave those links alone. I find those a buffer to keep the feed flowing.
- Until an ad logo appears, watch the time to make sure your getting the correct link. I block the 1st that's listed, I keep the second one in that happens afterwards.

## Xbox picks up video ads alot quicker.
- No reason why I have seperated them. Just to look back on which device I grabbed them from.
- This may be the reason blocking https://redirect.youtube.com no longer works. Stops the video from playing now when I try to block it.
