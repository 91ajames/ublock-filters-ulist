# ublock-filters-ulist
Personal block and white list with a few adlist domains that I have added to AdGuard Home along with Pi-Hole.

I look at the 1st `googlevideo` to block when they come in two consective query reposnses back to back. A relay from video to ad to video.
When there's a googlevideo with no ad after being est. 5 mins in, I just leave those links alone. I find those a buffer to keep the feed flowing.
